\textbf{Title:}  Comparing methods for estimating R0 from the size distribution of subcritical transimission chains

\textbf{Author:}  Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith

\textbf{Citation:}\cite{blumberg2013comparing}

\textbf{Link:} \url{blumberg2013comparing.pdf}

\textbf{Major themes:}  R0, SIR, outbreak, R0 does not represent epidemic threshold parameter.  (Individual-level model)

\textbf{Notes:} $R_0$ is the ``average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak.''

\textbf{Intro:}  Anderson and May have $R_0$ def.

$R_0$ can be found through individual-level contact tracing data or the more general Mass Action principle.  These two yield very different results.

Are ILMs like ABMs?  Why does $R_0$ change over time?

\textbf{Title:} The Asymptotic Distributions of Kernel Estimators of the Mode

\textbf{Author:}  William F. Eddy

\textbf{Citation:} \cite{eddy1982asymptotic}

\textbf{Link:} \url{eddy1982asymptotic.pdf}

\textbf{Major themes:}  Kernel estimate converges to a non-stationary Gaussian random process.  The covariance is related to the smoothness of the kernel.

\textbf{Notes:}  
\textbf{Intro}  Parzen shows that the empirical kernel estimate of the mode converges weakly in distribution to a Normal distribution centered at zero.  Eddy shows that a normalized version of the kernel estimate converges weakly to a random parabola through the origin.  From this, he shows that the maximum of the normalized kernel estimator converges weakly to a Gaussian.  Eddy gives a more general result here.
\textbf{Theorem}  The main theorem says that $Z_n \overset{d}{\to} Z$ where $Z_n$ and $Z$ are random processes.  Specifically, $E[Z_n]$ converges to a parabola.
Eddy analyzes the tail behavior under different conditions.

\textbf{Title:} Epidemic Modelling:  An Introduction

\textbf{Author:}  Daley and Gani

\textbf{Citation:} \cite{daley2001epidemic}

\textbf{Major themes:} Compartment models, SIR models, discrete and continuous time, stochastic models

\textbf{Summary:}  Daley and Gani take the reader through the basics of epidemic modelling, beginning with deterministic modelling and working up to stochastic modelling.  They work out many mathematical properties of the models they introduce along the way, one of which is Markov processes.

One of the models they use in depth is the S-R model also known as the death process.  The most discussed model is the classic SIR model.  Little attention is given to larger compartment models, but many variants of the SIR model are studied.  These variants include discrete or continuous time and strata.  The first is resolved with a method similar to Euler's method, while the second is resolved with matrix notation.

Very few of these equations have explicit solutions and generally seem to be toy examples when they do.

With regards to ABM, little is said although the book does provide guidance, especially with regards to strata.  One interesting direction would be look at multiple strata models together.  This would be very close to an ABM.

\textbf{Notes:}
\textbf{Ch. 1:}  Some history of disease modeling

``Hamer (1906) first foreshadowed the simple 'mass action' principle for a deterministic epidemic model in discrete time'' P. 8

The reproductive rate is $\rho= \gamma/\beta$ and if the intial number of susceptible persons must be greater than this for the epidemic to grow.  P. 9-10.

\textbf{1.4 Stochastic Modelling}

Most apparent in small populations that deterministic models do not work.  We can think that deterministic models are predicting the mean.

First stochastic model by McKendrick in 1926 but most famous by Frost -- chain binomial model.

Markov chains come up a lot.  P. 13.

\textbf{Ch. 2 Deterministic Models}

Again iterating that we are estimating the mean when using a deterministic model.

Derivation of SIR model on P. 28 and discussion of properties in the following pages.

Theorem 2.2 (P. 37) Stratified population.  Have a transition matrix $\textbf{B}$.

Ball and Clancy (1994) - paper on moving from strata to strata

2.7 Vector borne diseases

P. 51-52 discretizing time

\textbf{Ch. 3 Stochastic Models in Continuous Time}
Self described most important part of the book.

nonnegative integer valued Markov processes P.56

A \textit{simple stochastic (Markovian) epidemic model} in continuous time is one of which the population consists only of susceptibles and infectives (P. 57).  eg AIDS.  

Changing notation,

\begin{align*}
S(t) + I(t) = S(0) + I(0) \text{ (for all } t \ge 0)
\end{align*}
Time $t$ is continuous and $S$ and $I$ are nonnegative integers.  We thus have

\begin{align*}
P\{(S, I) (t + \delta t) = (i -1, j+1) | (S, I)(t)=(i,j) \} &= \beta i j \delta t + o(\delta t),\\
P\{ (S,I)(t + \delta t) = (i,j)|(S,I)(t)=(i,j) \} &= 1 - \beta ij \delta t - o(\delta t)
\end{align*}

We can thus compute the expected value at a certain time.  See P. 58.  Some difficult math follows.  Lots of Kolmogorov, and probability generating functions.

\textbf{3.5 The general stochastic epidemic in a stratified population}
You have $N$ people in $m$ strata.  There is no analytic solution known.  Can find general outbreak number.  Ex 3.5.2 (P. 92) m households.  Ex. 3.6 (carrier borne epidemic)

\textbf{4 Stochastic Models in Discrete Time}  Use of chain binomials.  4.5 graph theory

\textbf{5 Rumor Modelling}

\textbf{6 Fitting Epidemic Data}

\textbf{7 The Control of Epidemics}
The idea that if you're preventing an epidemic, then you should get better results that what you initially expect.  Three possible ways of curbing epidemics are :
\begin{itemize}
\item keeping \# of susceptibles low, eg immunization
\item accelerating rate of removal of infectives, eg medicine
\item lowering pairwise rate of infectius contact, eg isolation
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item How does underlying topology effect everything?
\item What can we do with the US population?
\item Variance?
\item What sort of ABMs can we build from strata compartment models?
\item How do we fit parameters in an ABM?
