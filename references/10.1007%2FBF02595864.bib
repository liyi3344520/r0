abstract="In this paper an overview of the existing literature about bootstrapping for estimation and prediction in time series is presented. Some of the methods are detailed, organized according to the aim they are designed for (estimation or prediction) and to the fact that some parametric structure is assumed, or not, for the dependence. Finally, some new bootstrap (kernel based) method is presented for prediction when no parametric assumption is made for the dependence.",
