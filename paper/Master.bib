abstract={Background Florida State has reported autochthonous transmission of Zika virus since late July 2016. Here we assessed the transmissibility associated with the outbreak and generated a short-term forecast. Methods Time-dependent dynamics of imported cases reported in the state of Florida was approximated by a logistic growth equation. We estimated the reproduction number using the renewal equation in order to predict the incidence of local cases arising from both local and imported primary cases. Using a bootstrap method together with the logistic and renewal equations, a short-term forecast of local and imported cases was carried out. Results The reproduction number was estimated at 0.16 (95 \% Confidence Interval: 0.13, 0.19). Employing the logistic equation to capture a drastic decline in the number of imported cases expected through the course of 2016, together with the low estimate of the local reproduction number in Florida, the expected number of local reported cases was demonstrated to show an evident declining trend for the remainder of 2016. Conclusions The risk of local transmission in the state of Florida is predicted to dramatically decline by the end of 2016.},

    abstract = {Author Summary Since the first reported major outbreak of Zika virus disease in Micronesia in 2007, the virus has caused outbreaks throughout the Pacific and South America. Transmitted by the Aedes genus of mosquitoes, the virus has been linked to possible neurological complications including Guillain-Barré Syndrome and microcephaly. To improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of Zika virus in island populations, we analysed the 2013–14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia. We found evidence that Zika virus infected the majority of the population, but only around 12\% of total infections on the archipelagos were reported as cases. If infection with Zika virus generates lifelong immunity, we estimate that it would take at least 12–20 years before there are enough susceptible people for the virus to re-emerge. Our results suggest that Zika virus could exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in the Pacific, producing large but sporadic outbreaks in small island populations.},

Behavioural changes required to reduce  below one were calculated.  Results Reported number of new partners per year was 0 to 16 (women) and 0 to 80 (men). When proportionate sexual mixing was assumed, the different methods yielded comparable  estimates. Assuming totally assortative mixing led to increased  estimates in the high sexual activity class while all estimates in the low-activity class were below one. Using the “effective” partner change rate introduced by Anderson and colleagues resulted in  estimates all above one except in the lowest sexual activity class.  could be reduced below one if: (a) medium risk individuals reduce their partner acquisition rate by 70\% and higher risk individuals reduce their partner acquisition rate by 93\%, or (b) higher risk individuals reduce the partner acquisition rate by 95\%.  Conclusions The estimated  depended strongly on the method used. Ignoring variation in sexual activity leads to an underestimation of . Relying on behaviour change alone to eradicate HIV may require unrealistically large reductions in risk behaviour, even though for a small proportion of the population. To control HIV, complementary prevention strategies such as male circumcision and HIV treatment services need rapid scale up.},

	abstract = {Mathematical and computational modeling approaches can be essential in providing quantitative scenarios of disease spreading, as well as projecting the impact in the population. Here we analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas with a microsimulation approach informed by high-definition demographic, mobility, and epidemic data. The model provides probability distributions for the time and place of introduction of Zika in Brazil, the estimate of the attack rate, timing of the epidemic in the affected countries, and the projected number of newborns from women infected by Zika. These results are potentially relevant in the preparation and analysis of contingency plans aimed at Zika virus control.We use a data-driven global stochastic epidemic model to analyze the spread of the Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas. The model has high spatial and temporal resolution and integrates real-world demographic, human mobility, socioeconomic, temperature, and vector density data. We estimate that the first introduction of ZIKV to Brazil likely occurred between August 2013 and April 2014 (90\% credible interval). We provide simulated epidemic profiles of incident ZIKV infections for several countries in the Americas through February 2017. The ZIKV epidemic is characterized by slow growth and high spatial and seasonal heterogeneity, attributable to the dynamics of the mosquito vector and to the characteristics and mobility of the human populations. We project the expected timing and number of pregnancies infected with ZIKV during the first trimester and provide estimates of microcephaly cases assuming different levels of risk as reported in empirical retrospective studies. Our approach represents a modeling effort aimed at understanding the potential magnitude and timing of the ZIKV epidemic and it can be potentially used as a template for the analysis of future mosquito-borne epidemics.},

 abstract = {Theory is linked with data to assess the probability of eradicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in San Francisco through the use of prophylactic vaccines. The necessary vaccine efficacy levels and population coverage levels for eradication are quantified. The likely impact of risk behavior changes on vaccination campaigns is assessed. The results show it is unlikely that vaccines will be able to eradicate HIV in San Francisco unless they are combined with considerable reductions in risk behaviors. Furthermore, if risk behavior increases as the result of a vaccination campaign, then vaccination could result in a perverse outcome by increasing the severity of the epidemic.},

abstract={Mathematical models in biology are powerful tools for the study and exploration of complex dynamics. Nevertheless, bringing theoretical results to an agreement with experimental observations involves acknowledging a great deal of uncertainty intrinsic to our theoretical representation of a real system. Proper handling of such uncertainties is key to the successful usage of models to predict experimental or field observations. This problem has been addressed over the years by many tools for model calibration and parameter estimation. In this article we present a general framework for uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation that is designed to handle uncertainties associated with the modeling of dynamic biological systems while remaining agnostic as to the type of model used. We apply the framework to fit an SIR-like influenza transmission model to 7 years of incidence data in three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal.},

abstract="P. B. M. Walker (1954) and H. C. Longuet-Higgins (quoted by Walker), as well as O. Scherbaum and G. Rasch (1957), made the first attempts towards a mathematical study of the age distribution in a cellular population. It was H. Von Foerster (1959), however, who derived the complete differential equation for the age density function,n(t, a). His equation is obtained from an analysis of the infinitesimal changes occurring during a time elementdt in a group of cells with ages betweena anda+da. The behavior of the population is determined by a quantity $\lambda$ which we call the loss function. In this paper a rigorous discussion of the Von Foerster equation is presented, and a solution is given for the special case when $\lambda$ depends, ont (time) anda (age) but not on other variables (such asn itself). It is also shown that the age density,n(t, a), is completely known only if the birth rate,$\alpha$(t), and the initial age distribution, $\beta$(a), are given as boundary conditions. In Section II the steady state solution and some plausible forms of intrinsic loss functions (depending ona only) are discussed in view of later applications.",

Firstly, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the vague convergence of the final size of the epidemic to the total progeny in an appropriate branching model, as the initial number of susceptibles tends to infinity. Then, an upper bound for the L1 distance between the statistics under study is derived, showing inter alia that the approximation may hold even when the initial number of infectives is arbitrarily large.

We present a modeling framework that utilizes these forms of data and builds on previous research pertaining to the quantitative analysis of animal movement. This approach provides additional insight into the environmental drivers of residence and movement as well as resource selection while accommodating path uncertainty.

	abstract = {Contact tracing, followed by treatment or isolation, is a key control measure in the battle against infectious diseases. It is an extreme form of locally targeted control, and as such has the potential to be highly efficient when dealing with low numbers of cases. For this reason it is frequently used to combat sexually transmitted diseases and new invading pathogens. Accurate modelling of contact tracing requires explicit information about the disease{\textendash}transmission pathways from each individual, and hence the network of contacts. Here, pairwise{\textendash}approximation methods and full stochastic simulations are used to investigate the utility of contact tracing. A simple relationship is found between the efficiency of contact tracing necessary for eradication and the basic reproductive ratio of the disease. This holds for a wide variety of realistic situations including heterogeneous networks containing core{\textendash}groups or super{\textendash}spreaders, and asymptomatic individuals. Clustering (transitivity) within the transmission network is found to destroy the relationship, requiring lower efficiency than predicted.},

There has therefore been great interest in developing statistical methods for inferring past population dynamics from gene genealogies reconstructed from molecular sequences. These “phylodynamic” methods take advantage of the fact that changes in population size can dramatically affect the shape of genealogies, making it possible to infer past changes in population size from a genealogy. However, in order for past population dynamics to be inferred, a demographic model must be specified. Current methods use demographic models that are often too simple for populations undergoing complex dynamics and generally do not allow for the parameters influencing the population dynamics to be estimated. We show how current phylodynamic methods can be extended to allow a much wider class of models to be fit to genealogies and illustrate our approach using an epidemiological model for the transmission of an infectious disease.},

 abstract = {Although per capita rates of increase (r) have been calculated by population biologists for decades, the inability to estimate uncertainty (variance) associated with r values has until recently precluded statistical comparisons of population growth rates. In this study, we used two computer-intensive techniques, jackknifing and Bootstrapping, to estimate bias, standard errors, and sampling distributions of r for real and hypothetical populations of cladocerans. Results generated using the two techniques, using data on laboratory cohorts of Daphnia pulex, were almost identical, as were results for a hypothetical D. pulex population whose sampling distribution was approximately normal. However, for another hypothetical population whose sampling distribution was negatively skewed due to high juvenile mortality, Bootstrap and full-sample estimates of r were negatively biased by 3.3 and 1.8%, respectively. A bias adjustment reduced the bias in the Bootstrap estimate and produced estimates of r and se(r) almost identical to those of the Jackknife technique. In general, our simulations show that the Jackknife will provide more cost-effective point and interval estimates of r for cladoceran populations, except when juvenile mortality is high (at least >25%). Coefficients of variation in the mean of r within laboratory cohorts of D. pulex were one-half to one-third the magnitude of the corresponding coefficients of variation in the mean of total reproduction and in the mean day to death (range of values of cv@?[r] = 1.6 to 3.8%). This suggests that extremes in reproductive output and survival of individuals tend to be dampened at the population level, and that within-cohort variability in r is not explosive. Moreover, between-cohort variability in r can be much greater than within-cohort variability, as indicated by a statistically significant difference of 30% (P @? .01) between the high and low r values that were computed for four cohorts of D. pulex born during a 1-mo period from the same laboratory stock population. based on variability in per capita rates of increase that have been estimated for several cladoceran species, we suggest that the precision for reporting r values should in most cases be limited to two significant figures.},

	abstract = {The reproduction number, , defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case, is a crucial quantity for identifying the intensity of interventions required to control an epidemic. Current estimates of the reproduction number for seasonal influenza show wide variation and, in particular, uncertainty bounds for for the pandemic strain from 1918 to 1919 have been obtained only in a few recent studies and are yet to be fully clarified. Here, we estimate using daily case notifications during the autumn wave of the influenza pandemic (Spanish flu) in the city of San Francisco, California, from 1918 to 1919. In order to elucidate the effects from adopting different estimation approaches, four different methods are used: estimation of using the early exponential-growth rate (Method 1), a simple susceptible{\textendash}exposed{\textendash}infectious{\textendash}recovered (SEIR) model (Method 2), a more complex SEIR-type model that accounts for asymptomatic and hospitalized cases (Method 3), and a stochastic susceptible{\textendash}infectious{\textendash}removed (SIR) with Bayesian estimation (Method 4) that determines the effective reproduction number at a given time t. The first three methods fit the initial exponential-growth phase of the epidemic, which was explicitly determined by the goodness-of-fit test. Moreover, Method 3 was also fitted to the whole epidemic curve. Whereas the values of obtained using the first three methods based on the initial growth phase were estimated to be 2.98 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.73, 3.25), 2.38 (2.16, 2.60) and 2.20 (1.55, 2.84), the third method with the entire epidemic curve yielded a value of 3.53 (3.45, 3.62). This larger value could be an overestimate since the goodness-of-fit to the initial exponential phase worsened when we fitted the model to the entire epidemic curve, and because the model is established as an autonomous system without time-varying assumptions. These estimates were shown to be robust to parameter uncertainties, but the theoretical exponential-growth approximation (Method 1) shows wide uncertainty. Method 4 provided a maximum-likelihood effective reproduction number 2.10 (1.21, 2.95) using the first 17 epidemic days, which is consistent with estimates obtained from the other methods and an estimate of 2.36 (2.07, 2.65) for the entire autumn wave. We conclude that the reproduction number for pandemic influenza (Spanish flu) at the city level can be robustly assessed to lie in the range of 2.0{\textendash}3.0, in broad agreement with previous estimates using distinct data.},

abstract="A major goal in clinical pharmacology is the quantitative prediction of drug effects. The field of pharmacokinetic--pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling has made many advances from the basic concept of the dose--response relationship to extended mechanism-based models. The purpose of this article is to review, from a historical perspective, the progression of the modelling of the concentration--response relationship from the first classic models developed in the mid-1960s to some of the more sophisticated current approaches. The emphasis is on general models describing key PD relationships, such as: simple models relating drug dose or concentration in plasma to effect, biophase distribution models and in particular effect compartment models, models for indirect mechanism of action that involve primarily the modulation of endogenous factors, models for cell trafficking and transduction systems. We show the evolution of tolerance and time-variant models, non- and semi-parametric models, and briefly discuss population PK/PD modelling, together with some example of more recent and complex pharmacodynamic models for control system and nonlinear HIV-1 dynamics. We also discuss some future possible directions for PK/PD modelling, report equations for general classes of novel semi-parametric models, as well as describing two new classes, additive or set-point, of regulatory, additive feedback models in their direct and indirect action variants",

abstract ={Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been the first severe contagious disease to emerge in the 21st century. The available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.},

We overview and discuss models for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), provide a critical survey of SARS modeling literature, and discuss promising future directions for research. We reconcile discrepancies between published estimates of the basic reproductive number R₀ for SARS (a crucial epidemiologic parameter), discuss insights regarding SARS control measures that have emerged uniquely from a modeling approach, and argue that high priorities for future modeling of SARS and similar respiratory EIDs should include informing quarantine policy and better understanding the impact of population heterogeneity on transmission patterns.},

This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus.},

journal={PLoS One},
volume={2},
number={3},
abstract={To predict the potential severity of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS, HIV, TB and smallpox, a summary parameter, the basic reproduction number R0, is generally calculated from a population-level model. R0 specifies the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual during his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak. R0 is used to assess the severity of the outbreak, as well as the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control. Conventionally, it is assumed that if R0>1 the outbreak generates an epidemic, and if R0<1 the outbreak becomes extinct. Here, we use computational and analytical methods to calculate the average number of secondary infections and to show that it does not necessarily represent an epidemic threshold parameter (as it has been generally assumed). Previously we have constructed a new type of individual-level model (ILM) and linked it with a population-level model. Our ILM generates the same temporal incidence and prevalence patterns as the population-level model; we use our ILM to directly calculate the average number of secondary infections (i.e., R0). Surprisingly, we find that this value of R0 calculated from the ILM is very different from the epidemic threshold calculated from the population-level model. This occurs because many different individual-level processes can generate the same incidence and prevalence patterns. We show that obtaining R0 from empirical contact tracing data collected by epidemiologists and using this R0 as a threshold parameter for a population-level model could produce extremely misleading estimates of the infectiousness of the pathogen, the severity of an outbreak, and the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for control.},

The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

abstract="Purpose: To compare the performance of the standard lag time model (LAG model) with the performance of an analytical solution of the transit compartment model (TRANSIT model) in the evaluation of four pharmacokinetic studies with four different compounds. Methods: The population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using NONMEM on concentration--time data of glibenclamide, furosemide, amiloride, and moxonidine. In the TRANSIT model, the optimal number of transit compartments was estimated from the data. This was based on an analytical solution for the change in drug concentration arising from a series of transit compartments with the same first-order transfer rate between each compartment. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by the decrease in objective function value (OFV) and by inspection of diagnostic graphs. Results: With the TRANSIT model, the OFV was significantly lower and the goodness-of-fit was markedly improved in the absorption phase compared with the LAG model for all drugs. The parameter estimates related to the absorption differed between the two models while the estimates of the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters were similar. Conclusion: Based on these results, the TRANSIT model is an attractive alternative for modeling drug absorption delay, especially when a LAG model poorly describes the drug absorption phase or is numerically unstable.",
